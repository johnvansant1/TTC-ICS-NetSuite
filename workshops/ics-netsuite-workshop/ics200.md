# Lab 200 - Integrating with NetSuite using ICS

## Introduction

This is the second lab in the **Integrating with NetSuite using ICS Workshop**. 

In this lab, you will learn how to create an integration with NetSuite using a basic orchestration in ICS. 

The ICS integration that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

![](images/200/image000.png)

Here is a description of what is happening with this integration:

Postman will be used to test the exposed REST service endpoint of the ICS integration called *UserXX NetSuite Query* (where XX will be 00 -> 10).  This integration has 2 connections.  The incoming message is received by the incoming *UserXX REST* REST Connection.  The *UserXX NetSuite Query* orchestration makes a query into the NetSuite SaaS application using the *UserXX NetSuite* connection to get details of the NetSuite business objects.  After the query is made, a few fields from the result are returned to the calling client, Postman.

## Objectives

- Learn how to create ICS REST and NetSuite Connections
- Learn how to create an ICS Orchestration using the ICS Adapters
- Learn how to test the ICS integration using Postman

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.
- A NetSuite sandbox environment that will be supplied by your instructor.
- Postman will need to be installed for ICS integration testing - see "Prerequisites" section of the workshop for details

## Part 1: Create the ICS Connections

### **1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account

---

**1.1.1** From your browser (Firefox or Chrome recommended) go to the following URL:
<https://cloud.oracle.com>

**1.1.2** Click Sign In in the upper right hand corner of the browser
**IMPORTANT** - Under My Services, change Data Center to `US Commercial 2 (us2)` and click on Sign In to My Services

## Part 2: Create the ICS Integration

---

### **2.1**: Create Orchestration Integration

**2.1.1** On the left-hand navigation of the Connections screen select the "Integrations" link

![](images/200/image023.png)

**2.1.2** Select the **New Integration** button in the top of the Integrations screen

![](images/200/image024.png)

**2.1.3** In the **Create Integration - Select a Style/Pattern**, select the **Orchestration** style.  We want to use this because our integration may have multiple invocations to the NetSuite system at a later point - the **Basic Map Data** style only has a single target service invocation as well as additional invocations for data enrichment of the payload before the target invocation call is made.

![](images/200/image025.png)

**2.1.4** Fill in the information for the new orchestration

- **What triggers this integration?:** Select the radio button for `Application event or business object`.  Note that integrations can be scheduled to run at specific times if the `Schedule` trigger type is selected.
- **What do you want to call your integration?:** Enter the name in the form of _UserXX NetSuite Query_ where XX is the number in your allocated user.
- **Identifier:** Accept the default - this value will be generated based on the name you enter.
- **Version:** Accept the default - if you want to clone and create newer versions later, you can change to a higher version than **01.00.0000** which is the default.

After you've filled in the information, select the **Create** button

![](images/200/image026.png)

**2.1.5** Observe the design canvas for the new integration.  (The various features of the ICS designer were covered in lab 100 **Exploring ICS** earlier in this workshop)

![](images/200/image027.png)

**2.1.6** Create the Trigger for the orchestration. This integration will have a REST endpoint as defined when we created the **UserXX REST** connector earlier.

Expand the list of REST Triggers by clicking on the **REST(X)** link (where `X` will be the number of REST connections in the ICS instance - this will vary depending on how many others are running the workshop together).

Click and drag your REST connection identified by your assigned user (ie: `UserXX REST`) over to the **Start** target.  

(Note: After you click and start dragging your connection, the `Triggers` connection tray on the left hand side of the designer will become hidden)

![](images/200/image028.png)

**2.1.7** Drop your connection onto the large *Plus Sign* inside the *Start* circle.

![](images/200/image029.png)

**2.1.8** Fill in the required values on **Basic Info** page, and click **Next >**

- **What do you want to call your endpoint?** _NetSuiteQuery_
- **What is the endpoint's relative resource URI** _/NetSuiteQuery_
- **What action does the endpoint perform?** _POST_
- **Configure a request payload for this endpoint** _Checked_
- **Configure for this endpoint to receive a response** _Checked_

![](images/200/image030.png)

**2.1.9** Select **JSON Sample**, select **JSON** in *type of payload* and click on **<<< inline >>>** to enter a sample JSON request payload

![](images/200/image031.png)

**2.1.10** Enter the following JSON into the **Enter Sample JSON**, then click **Ok**

```javascript
{
"parameter1":"string",
"parameter2":"string"
}
```

![](images/200/image032.png)

**2.1.11** Click on **Next >** to move on to the _Response_

**2.1.12** In the *Configure the Response Payload* screen, select **JSON Sample**, select **JSON** in **type of payload** and click on **<<< inline >>>** to enter sample JSON

![](images/200/image033.png)

**2.1.13** Enter the following JSON into the **Enter Sample JSON**, and click **Ok**

```javascript
{
"response1": "response string1",
"response2": "response string2"
}
```

![](images/200/image034.png)

**2.1.14** Back on the Response Page,  click **Next >**

![](images/200/image035.png)

**2.1.15** After reviewing the trigger details, click **Done**.

![](images/200/image036.png)

**2.1.16** The ICS design canvas will now show the Trigger named _NetSuiteQuery_ along with the mapping and return nodes of the same name.

**2.1.17** It is a good practice to periodically save your work.  Select the *Save* button in the upper right corner.
